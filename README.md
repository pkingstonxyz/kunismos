*κυνισμός -οῦ* | Cynical philosophy or conduct

Kunismos is a journalling application that is designed to get out of your way so that you can live your life.

There are no frills. Once you have an account, you write, press ctrl+enter and your entry is saved in your journal.

Should you want to look back on your entries, you may, but the point is to remove as many hurdles in between you and the act of writing as is possible.
